-- | Set the expectation that a response matches a specified `ResponseMatcher`.
--
-- A @ResponseMatcher@ matches a response if:
--
-- * the specified status matches the HTTP response status code
--
-- * the specified body (if any) matches the response body
--
-- * the response has all of the specified `Header` fields
--   (the response may have arbitrary additional `Header` fields)
--
-- You can use @ResponseMatcher@'s (broken) `Num` instance to match for a HTTP
-- status code:
--
-- > get "/" `shouldRespondWith` 200
-- > -- matches if status is 200
--
-- You can use @ResponseMatcher@'s `IsString` instance to match for a HTTP
-- status @200@ and a body:
--
-- > get "/" `shouldRespondWith` "foo"
-- > -- matches if body is "foo" and status is 200
--
-- If you want to match for a different HTTP status, you can use record update
-- notation to specify `matchStatus` explicitly:
--
-- > get "/" `shouldRespondWith` "foo" {matchStatus = 404}
-- > -- matches if body is "foo" and status is 404
--
-- If you want to require a specific header field you can specify
-- `matchHeaders`:
--
-- > get "/" `shouldRespondWith` "foo" {matchHeaders = ["Content-Type" <:> "text/plain"]}
-- > -- matches if body is "foo", status is 200 and there is a header field "Content-Type: text/plain"
